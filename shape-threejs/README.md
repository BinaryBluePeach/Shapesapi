# shape-threejs

Shape Three.js is an example of integrating a shape in a 3D scene.

### Prerequisites:

You will need an API key for your shape from the [Shapes Inc.](https://shapes.inc) developer dashboard.

The example uses Kokoro TTS for text to speech. The model will be downloaded on first run, which takes some time.

### Setup:
1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`
2. Fill in the values for the environment variables
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`

### Usage:

Open the app in your browser. The shape will be displayed in a 3D scene.
You can interact with the shape by clicking on it. The shape will respond with a text to speech response.
